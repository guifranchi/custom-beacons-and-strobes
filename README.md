X-Plane 11 XLua script to customise timings for strobe and beacon flickers

### How do I get set up? ###

* Download and install as a plugin folder for any X-Plane 11 aircraft (eg. <x-plane root>\/Aircraft\/<My Aircraft>\/plugins\/)
  Merge with any existing xlua folder, or just install the custom-lights scripts subdirectory
* Customise the top of the lua script to suit
